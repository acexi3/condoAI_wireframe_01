# Condo.AI Platform Manager - Wireframe

## Overview
Condo.AI Platform Manager is an AI-powered condominium management system designed to streamline document handling, automate meeting minutes, and provide intelligent access to condominium information. This repository contains the interactive wireframe prototype demonstrating the planned user interface and core interactions.

### Current Status: Wireframe Prototype
This version represents the UI/UX design implementation and includes:
- User interface layouts
- Navigation flows
- Component hierarchy
- Basic interactions

## Features Demonstrated

### 1. Document Management Interface
- Document upload and minting capabilities
- Blockchain integration preparation
- Role-based folder structure
- Secure document access controls

### 2. AI Chat Interface
- Conversational UI for document queries
- Context-aware chat system layout
- Historical conversation tracking

### 3. User Access Levels
- Property Manager view
- Board Member access
- Owner/Resident permissions
- Maintenance and Staff interfaces

## Technical Stack
